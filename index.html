        <p>It was a dark and stromy night...</p>
        <p>"What are ya doin' in mah swamp?!", a voice called out.</p>
        <p>"I'm searching for my pet gator. Accidentially flushed hium down the toilet. Seen any gators around?", he replied.</p>
        <p>"No, I have not" replied the old. What swamp is this? </P>
        <p>"It's my swamp. I live here!", he said. "Sorry about your pet gator. Why don't you take this donkey instead?"</p>
        <p>"That's perfect! Little Jimmy would have never forgiven me for losing his pet gator, Bumbles. He loves donkeys, so I think he'll forget about Bumbles in no time. I think I'll name him..."</p>
        <p>Patrick, I'll call him Patrick in honor of Timmy's favorite cartoon.</p>
